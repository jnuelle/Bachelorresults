# Bachelorresults
All results of my Bachelor thesis about 'Investigation of Drift Invariances in Fully Convolutional Neural Networks'

All test result are available in the 'all.txt' and 'day.txt'

The diffrent results for each run can be found in the folders run*.

Unfortunately the trained models are around 50GB and so to big to be upload here, so they'll be uploaded soon somewhere else.
